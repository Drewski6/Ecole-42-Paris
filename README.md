  - Description: intro to object oriented programming with the strictest possible language to do it.
    Everything must be compiled with -Wall -Wextra -Werror (for immediate compiler failures on all errors).
    No use of the STL (standard template library) until the final 2 projects.
    Only using C++ 98 standard which leaves out a lot of quality of life features. 
    If you want to do something, you have to do it from scratch.
